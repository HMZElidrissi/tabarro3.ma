As part of promoting voluntary and regular blood donation, the **Moroccan Agency for Blood and Blood Derivatives (AMSD)** is launching its **monthly program of blood donation campaigns for November 2025**.

This initiative aims to **strengthen regional blood product reserves** and **raise awareness among citizens** about the importance of regular donation. With the combined efforts of local associations, healthcare professionals, and volunteers, several actions are planned throughout the month across the region.

Blood donation remains a **civic and solidarity-driven act** that directly helps save lives. The Union invites all citizens aged **18 to 50** to take part in these campaigns in a spirit of responsibility and brotherhood.
