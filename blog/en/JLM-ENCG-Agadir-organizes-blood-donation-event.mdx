At t**abarro3.ma**, we believe that real change happens when committed organizations come together around a shared vision: serving the community and strengthening social solidarity. Our partnership with **JLM ENCG Agadir (Jeunes Leaders Marocains)** is a powerful example of how youth engagement, civic responsibility, and humanitarian values can translate into concrete impact on the ground.

### A Successful Blood Donation Event

One of the most remarkable milestones of this partnership was the **blood donation event** organized jointly by tabarro3 and JLM ENCG Agadir on the 30th and 31st of October, which welcomed **more than 180 participants**. This strong turnout reflects not only the effectiveness of the organization and coordination, but also the growing awareness among young people about the importance of blood donation as a life-saving act.

Each participant contributed to a collective effort that goes far beyond numbers, helping hospitals, supporting patients in urgent need, and reinforcing a culture of altruism and responsibility within the student and local community.

### A Consistent Commitment: 5 Blood Donation Events Hosted

This event is part of a broader, long-term commitment. To date, **JLM ENCG Agadir has hosted a total of five blood donation events**, demonstrating consistency, seriousness, and dedication to public health causes. Through careful planning, mobilization of volunteers, and collaboration with medical partners, these initiatives have created sustainable impact and encouraged first-time donors to become regular contributors.

tabarro3 is proud to support and amplify such efforts that align perfectly with our mission of promoting humanitarian action and social engagement.

### Beyond Blood Donation: A Broader Humanitarian Vision

The partnership between tabarro3 and JLM ENCG Agadir extends well beyond blood donation campaigns. The club has actively participated in **multiple humanitarian aid initiatives**, including solidarity actions, community support events, and awareness campaigns addressing social and human needs.

These initiatives reflect a holistic approach to leadership ,one that combines academic excellence with ethical responsibility and active citizenship. By empowering students to engage in humanitarian work, JLM ENCG Agadir is shaping a new generation of leaders who understand that success is measured not only by personal achievement, but also by positive societal impact.

### Looking Ahead

Our collaboration with **JLM of ENCG Agadir** is built on shared values: solidarity, commitment, and service. As tabarro3 continues its mission to support humanitarian initiatives across Morocco, we look forward to strengthening this partnership and launching even more impactful projects together.

Together, we are proving that when youth organizations and civil initiatives unite, they can inspire action, save lives, and build a more compassionate society.
