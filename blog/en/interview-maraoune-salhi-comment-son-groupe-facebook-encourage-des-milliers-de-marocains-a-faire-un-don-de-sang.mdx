**How did you come up with the idea of creating this Facebook group to organize blood drives?**

“During my internship at the Oujda Blood Transfusion Center in the immuno‑hematology lab, I faced an emergency: a relative urgently needed blood. That’s when I realized how limited reserves could be. I wanted to create a space to facilitate donations and help others in critical situations. I myself have donated blood several times, understanding how important this act is and the impact it can have on patients’ lives.”

**How did you attract the first members and start mobilizing the community?**

“We reached out to local associations, health clubs, hospitals, and blood transfusion centers to spread the word. This collaboration was essential to raise awareness of our initiative and encourage donations.”

**How do you manage member requests, questions, and discussions?**

“Every day, I take time to read members’ posts, comments, and direct messages. I also enable notifications to be alerted to new activity and respond quickly to urgent requests.”

**Are there moments or testimonies that particularly moved you and motivated you to go even further?**

“One day, a mother shared a heart‑wrenching story. Her child needed an urgent transfusion after an accident, and thanks to donors mobilized through the group, their life was saved. She expressed immense gratitude, saying that without this solidarity, her child would not be here today.”

The Alliance des Donneurs de Sang au Maroc demonstrates the power of social media when used responsibly. This Facebook group is more than an online platform: it is a community united around a noble cause, where each donation can make the difference between life and death.

Today, thanks to the ongoing mobilization of members and the commitment of its administrator, hundreds of people have been saved. An inspiring example of solidarity that reminds us everyone can act, at their own scale, for the common good.
