Founded in **1989**, the **Meknassata Azzaytoune Association of Blood Donors** is one of the **first organizations of its kind in Morocco**. Since its inception, it has worked tirelessly to **promote a culture of blood donation** and raise awareness among citizens about the importance of this humanitarian act.

Under the supervision of **Mr. Nour Eddine El Amine**, a **new blood donation campaign** was launched on **July 10** at **Place Nîmes in Hamriya, Meknes**. Collections take place every evening from **6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.**, in a warm and supportive atmosphere.

Every day, **between 30 and 70 donors** answer the call, demonstrating the generosity and sense of responsibility that characterize the people of Meknes.

The campaigns are still ongoing at **Place Nîmes**, starting at **6:00 p.m.**, allowing as many people as possible to take part in this national movement of solidarity.

Thanks to its ongoing actions and the mobilization of its volunteers, the Meknassata Azzaytoune Association of Blood Donors remains a **key pillar in blood donation awareness in Morocco**, inspiring other initiatives across the country.
