## What Is Leukemia?

Leukemia is a **blood cancer** that affects the bone marrow and lymphatic system, disrupting the normal production of blood cells. It is classified into four main types:

1. **Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)**: Rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells invading the blood and bone marrow.
2. **Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)**: Mostly affects children and progresses quickly.
3. **Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)**: Develops slowly over several years, caused by a genetic mutation.
4. **Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)**: Evolves slowly and mainly affects adults.

## Risks and Symptoms

While no single cause is identified, certain factors increase the risk of developing leukemia:

- Exposure to toxic chemicals (benzene, pesticides)
- Family history of leukemia
- Pre-existing blood disorders

Common symptoms include **extreme fatigue, recurrent infections, abnormal bleeding, and unexplained weight loss**.

## Diagnosis and Treatments

Diagnosis relies on **blood tests and bone marrow biopsies**. Treatments vary depending on the type of leukemia and the patient’s condition:

- **Chemotherapy**: Drugs that destroy cancer cells
- **Radiotherapy**: X-rays to eliminate diseased cells
- **Bone Marrow Transplant**: Replacing diseased marrow with healthy marrow
- **Targeted Therapies**: Innovative treatments that target cellular abnormalities

## The Crucial Role of Blood Transfusions

Following chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant, patients often suffer from a **deficit in blood cells**. Transfusions play a vital role in recovery:

- **Red blood cell deficit (anemia)**: Causes severe fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness
- **White blood cell deficit (immunodeficiency)**: Increases the risk of serious infections
- **Platelet deficit (thrombocytopenia)**: High risk of hemorrhage and uncontrolled bleeding

Blood transfusions help **stabilize the patient’s condition**, improve quality of life, and optimize recovery chances.

## A Call for Solidarity

Blood donation is essential for patients with leukemia. By donating, **you can help save lives** and bring hope to those in need.
