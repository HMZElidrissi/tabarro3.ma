### A Tradition of Giving Back

On September 25th and 26th, the Rotaract UEMF Club organized a blood donation campaign at Euromed University of Fes, uniting students, staff, and volunteers around a vital cause: donating blood to save lives.

### A Legacy of Service

Since its creation, Rotaract UEMF has organized 10 blood donation campaigns on campus and 11 overall, making it one of the most active and impactful student clubs at the university. Beyond blood drives, the club has carried out numerous social, cultural, and humanitarian initiatives, strengthening its role as a leader in student engagement and community service.

### Promoting Innovation with tabarro3

This year’s campaign also introduced participants to [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/), a platform that connects patients in urgent need of blood with willing donors. Registered donors receive real-time notifications whenever someone nearby requires their blood type, ensuring a faster and more effective response. By promoting tabarro3, the club extended its impact beyond the event, linking community action with technology.

### Inspiring the Next Generation

Driven by dedicated students, Rotaract UEMF continues to inspire generosity, leadership, and responsibility within the Euromed community. With every initiative, the club proves that small, consistent actions can create meaningful change, on campus and beyond.
