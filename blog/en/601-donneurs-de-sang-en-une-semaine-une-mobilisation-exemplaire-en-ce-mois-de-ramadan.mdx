The **Moroccan Agency for Blood and Blood Derivatives** in the **Tangier–Tetouan–Al Hoceima** region, in coordination with the **Delegation of Islamic Affairs**, launched a major blood donation campaign during the month of Ramadan. The initiative aims to **meet urgent hospital needs** while encouraging citizens to join this movement of solidarity.

### Collections Organized Every Evening in Mosques

Every evening after the Isha prayer, **blood drives are organized in two mosques in Tangier**. This organization allows worshippers to contribute to this noble cause after their prayers. Thanks to **well‑coordinated logistics and a dedicated team** of healthcare professionals and volunteers, the drives take place under optimal conditions, ensuring donor safety and comfort.

### Strong Engagement From the First Week

Participation has been strong: **601 people donated blood in the first week**, a promising figure that reflects the **generosity and spirit of solidarity** that characterize this holy month.

### Success Made Possible by Partners

This momentum would not have been possible without the involvement of many stakeholders. The **Regional Delegation of Islamic Affairs** and the **Local Scientific Council of Tangier** played a key role in raising awareness about the importance of blood donation. The **Red Crescent** also contributed significantly by ensuring the smooth running of the drives.

### A Call to Sustain the Momentum

With such a strong start, organizers hope to **maintain this dynamic** and encourage even more citizens to donate. In this month where generosity is central to social values, **every donation is deeply meaningful**, saving lives and bringing hope to patients in need.

Collections continue throughout the month, with the goal of attracting even more donors. [**See the schedule of upcoming drives here.**](https://tabarro3.ma/campaigns)
