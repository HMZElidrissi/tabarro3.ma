In the framework of a purposeful civil partnership, the Iqraa Foundation in Ben Ahmed, in direct coordination with the Moroccan Association of Blood Donors, announced the organization of a humanitarian solidarity blood donation campaign. The campaign launched today and will continue until next Monday, with the participation of civil society actors, volunteers, and citizens who responded to the call of collective responsibility. This initiative comes in a social context where there is an increasing need to strengthen blood stocks in health institutions, especially with the high demand associated with emergencies and surgeries, making blood donation campaigns a fundamental pillar within the health solidarity system.

In this initiative, the Iqraa Foundation adopted a logic of practical partnership with the Moroccan Association of Blood Donors, as a national body that has accumulated field experience in organizing donation campaigns, supervising volunteers, and ensuring compliance with approved health standards. Prior coordination was established between the two parties to provide qualified medical staff, ensure good reception, and secure health safety conditions, ensuring the success of the campaign and the achievement of its humanitarian goals. This cooperation reflects an advanced awareness of the importance of uniting efforts among civil society components, in light of increasing health challenges that impose joint action instead of isolated initiatives.

The organizing body emphasizes that blood donation goes beyond being a medical procedure to carry a clear civic dimension, as it consolidates values of solidarity and collective responsibility, and enhances the sense of belonging to the community. The donor offers part of their time and effort to serve another human being they may not know, but the human bond remains through this act, which contributes directly to saving lives and alleviating the suffering of patients and their families. In this context, the Iqraa Foundation renewed its call to various partners and local actors, in addition to the general public capable of donating, for positive engagement in this campaign and supporting its noble goals.

Since the early hours of the campaign launch, a remarkable influx of donors from various age groups was recorded, reflecting the increasing level of awareness of the importance of blood donation, and the effectiveness of the sensitization efforts that preceded the organization of this initiative. The supervising staff was keen to provide the necessary clarifications to donors and answer their questions, with strict adherence to applicable medical procedures, and adopting an organization that ensures the smoothness of the process and avoids overcrowding.

This campaign highlights the growing role played by civil society in supporting the health system, through field initiatives that contribute to filling part of the deficit and enhancing trust between citizens and institutions. This initiative also constitutes an occasion to consolidate the culture of volunteering among youth, and introduce them to the importance of engaging in organized humanitarian work, based on planning, coordination, and evaluation.

The Iqraa Foundation confirmed, in its press release organizing the campaign, that the primary goal is to effectively contribute to saving lives and spreading hope among patients, emphasizing that every donor constitutes an essential element in the chain of human giving. It also stressed that this campaign falls within a vision that seeks to make voluntary work a continuous practice, linked to consciousness and responsibility, and not just an occasional activity. For its part, the Moroccan Association of Blood Donors praised the level of organization and response, considering the partnership with the Iqraa Foundation a positive model for local cooperation based on serving the public interest.

The two organizing bodies do not view this initiative as an isolated activity, but as a station within a continuous path of solidarity work, which requires continuity and permanent mobilization. Health challenges impose collective readiness and conscious engagement from various actors, which is what this campaign seeks to consecrate at the local level. This initiative constitutes a practical example of the ability of organized civil action to create real impact, consolidate values of volunteering and citizenship, and make solidarity a daily practice that serves humans and society.
