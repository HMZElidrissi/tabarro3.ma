Blood donation is an act of solidarity that saves lives, but there are situations where it is essential not to take part. To ensure the safety of recipients, strict medical criteria are applied. Here are the four main contraindications to blood donation and why some health conditions make donating risky.

### 1. History of Blood Transfusion

People who have received a blood transfusion in the past should avoid donating blood. Although transfusions are safe, there remains a residual risk of transmitting pathogens, sometimes undetectable at an early stage. This represents a potential threat to recipients, hence the prohibition in such cases.

### 2. Leprosy: Risk of Transmission

Leprosy, though rare, is an infectious disease that can have serious effects, especially on the nervous system. The blood of individuals with leprosy may contain infectious agents that can be transmitted via transfusion. For recipient safety, donation must be avoided in this case.

### 3. HIV/AIDS: Preventing Transmission Risks

HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and AIDS are viral infections that weaken the immune system. These viruses can be transmitted through blood, making transfusions risky if the donor is a carrier. Therefore, individuals living with HIV or AIDS are excluded from donating blood to prevent transmission.

### 4. Viral Hepatitis: A High Transmission Risk

Viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C, can cause irreversible liver damage and is transmitted through blood. Because these viruses can persist in bodily fluids, people with hepatitis cannot donate blood. This precaution is essential to protect recipients from potential contamination.

In conclusion, while blood donation is essential to saving lives, it is crucial to follow safety criteria to avoid any risk to recipients. People with specific medical histories should refrain from donating to ensure the safety of this vital act of solidarity.
