Japan has made a historic breakthrough by developing **universal artificial blood** compatible with all blood types. This advancement could revolutionize emergency medicine, surgery, and the management of natural disasters.

## An Innovation by Japanese Researchers

The project is led by a research team at **Nara Medical University**, headed by Professor **Hiromi Sakai**. The artificial blood relies on **hemoglobin vesicles**, produced from human hemoglobin recovered from expired blood bags. The hemoglobin is encapsulated in an artificial membrane, **removing the antigens responsible for blood types**, resulting in a product compatible with all blood groups.

## What Are the Advantages?

This artificial blood could transform medical care in many contexts:

- **Universal compatibility**: Can be used without prior compatibility testing
- **Extended shelf life**: Up to **2 years at room temperature** (and up to 5 years refrigerated), compared to 42 days for traditional human blood
- **Reduced infection risk**: No viruses or pathogens, thanks to strict purification
- **A major asset in emergencies**: Ideal for remote areas, natural disasters, or armed conflicts

## Where Does the Research Stand?

The first **clinical trials** began in **March 2025** on healthy volunteers receiving between 100 and 400 ml of the product. So far, **no serious adverse effects** have been reported, paving the way for larger‑scale testing.

Researchers hope for **widespread use by 2030**, subject to clinical outcomes.

Universal artificial blood could provide a sustainable response to **chronic blood donation shortages**, particularly in countries where blood banks are under‑supplied. It may also reduce risks associated with incompatible or contaminated transfusions.
