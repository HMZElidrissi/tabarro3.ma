As part of promoting voluntary and regular blood donation, the **Moroccan Agency for Blood and Blood Derivatives (AMSD)** is launching its **monthly program of blood donation campaigns for December 2025**.

This initiative aims to **strengthen regional blood reserves** and **raise public awareness** about the importance of regular donation. With the joint mobilization of the UM5 medical-social center in Rabat, healthcare professionals, and volunteers, several actions are planned throughout the month across the region.

Blood donation remains a **civic and solidarity‑driven act** that directly helps save lives. The Union invites all citizens aged **18 to 60** to participate widely in these campaigns with a sense of responsibility and fraternity.

🔗 **The detailed schedule of collections is available on this [link](https://tabarro3.ma/campaigns).**
