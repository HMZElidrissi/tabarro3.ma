Due to the constant increase in blood demand, citizen initiatives remain essential to support healthcare facilities and save lives. While demand for blood products grows every year, donations remain insufficient, particularly during certain sensitive periods such as summer, holidays, or school vacations. It is in this context that the second edition of the solidarity marathon dedicated to blood donation was organized in Marrakech, on the initiative of [the Nakhil Association of Blood Donors](https://www.instagram.com/ands.marrakech/).

This new edition builds on the success of the first and aimed to raise public awareness of the importance of blood donation, promote a culture of regular donation, and attract new donors. It also sought to help boost blood stocks, which are often at critical levels.

Under the slogan “One step for them... so that life can go on,” the initiative was structured around two key events. A blood donation campaign, organized by the Nakhil Association of Blood Donors, in collaboration with the Moroccan Blood and Blood Products Agency's Marrakech-Safi region, collected a significant number of blood bags (169 donors), making a concrete contribution to the needs of hospitals. At the same time, a road race brought together many participants: experienced athletes, amateurs, volunteers, and civil society actors, all united by the same commitment to solidarity.

Beyond the sporting aspect, this marathon conveyed a powerful message of solidarity and civic responsibility. Through their commitment, each participant helped raise awareness among a wide audience about the importance of blood donation. The event concluded with an awards ceremony for the winners, attended by local authorities and representatives of associations.

This second edition confirms the essential role of the Nakhil Blood Donors Association in promoting blood donation in Marrakech and demonstrates that sport is a powerful lever for mobilizing, raising awareness, and transmitting strong human values. Through this solidarity initiative, a clear message is sent to everyone: **every gesture counts and can save lives**.
