On **January 9**, the **Rotaract Club Tanger Doyen** organized a **blood drive** to support local hospitals. This event, driven by solidarity and commitment, brought together many participants eager to contribute to a vital cause. We spoke with club members, who shared their motivation and vision for this initiative.

**What inspired you to organize this blood drive, and what message do you want to convey to your community?**

“We were inspired by a simple idea: a small gesture, like donating blood, can save lives. It’s accessible to most of us, and its impact is immense, as our campaign demonstrates. Through this action, we want to show our community that helping others is within everyone’s reach and that **together, we can create real change**.”

**What impact do you hope this initiative will have on participants?**

“We hope it reminds everyone of **the power of giving and solidarity**. For donors, it’s the opportunity to realize they truly helped someone in need. For other participants, especially Rotaract members and students, we hope it inspires them to get involved in future solidarity actions and to understand the importance of teamwork and kindness in building a better world.”

With this event, Rotaract Club Tanger Doyen has once again proven that **collective engagement can have a tangible, positive impact on society**.
