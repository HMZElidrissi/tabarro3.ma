# How tabarro3.ma started?

It started with frustration, honestly. In September 2022, Zineb had just finished her studies and was scrolling through Twitter during her two-month break before starting her thesis. She saw an article about blood stock shortages and wanted to share it, but realized her Twitter content wasn't serious enough for such important topics. So she created a dedicated page to share blood donation information instead.

There wasn't some grand inspiring momentâ€”just a simple "I can do this better" feeling about blood donation communication in Morocco. She started by sharing info, then gradually dove deeper into research about the subject. Her following really took off during the Al Haouz earthquake, when people desperately needed reliable information about blood donations.

Meanwhile, Hamza was inspired by Zineb's social media work and had his own personal experience with blood shortages. He turned it into a side projectâ€”his first GitHub commit for the platform was on February 25, 2024. The real launch happened when he partnered with Rotaract Les MÃ©rinides on October 15, 2024, organizing two blood donation events in Fes.

The pieces came together when Zineb officially joined the adventure on January 28, 2025, bringing her social media community with her. What started as separate frustrations became a shared mission: making blood donation easier, more accessible, and more impactful for everyone in Morocco.

This handbook is a short guide to our principles and way of working. As tabarro3.ma continues to grow, our biggest hope is that these values help every new member feel at ease, inspired and ready to contribute.

If you are new, _Welcome_. It's your energy and passion that will shape the impact we can have on Morocco.

Thank you for joining us. Together, let's make generosity the easiest choice anyone can make.

# Part I: Welcome to tabarro3.ma

## First day

So, you've connected with the team, perhaps through a campaign or online, and you're ready to dive in. Welcome! [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/) operates with a unique spirit of volunteerism and autonomy, the first thing you should do is provide your email and Whatsapp number if you didn't already. Of course we shouldn't have to tell you to create an account as a donor in tabarro3.ma ðŸ˜Š.

## Who we are?

[tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/) is a community project of Rotaract Les MÃ©rinides, a service club based in Fez affiliated with Rotary International.

We are a nonprofit platform, with one clear goal: to build a culture where donating blood becomes a natural habit, a shared responsibility, and a proud act of citizenship.

We are a community of donors and volunteers who believe that giving blood should be as simple as possible.

We are people who care â€” about the patient waiting in a hospital bed, about the family hoping for a miracle, and about the neighbor or stranger whose life can be saved with a single act of generosity.

## What we do?

-   We connect people in need of blood with potential donors through a matching system based on blood type and geographical location.
-   When an urgent blood request is created, immediate notifications (SMS and email) are sent to compatible donors in the specified area.
-   We keep users informed about the latest blood donation events and campaigns happening in their specific regions and cities.
-   We make information about blood donation easy to understand, covering everything from the donation process to eligibility criteria.
-   We provide you with practical details about blood donation locations in Morocco and opening hours.
-   Stay informed about the latest news, events, and initiatives related to blood donation across the country.

## What we don't do?

-   We do not store, transport, or handle actual blood products.
-   We do not provide medical service.
-   We do not charge fees for any of our services.
-   We do not guarantee blood availability or compatibility.

## Why we exist?

We exist because the need is urgent and personal. Lives in Morocco hang in the balance every day, waiting for donors. We were founded out of a shared frustration with the difficulty of finding reliable information and efficient ways to donate or receive blood, especially during emergencies like the Al Haouz earthquake. We believe that generosity should be the easiest choice anyone can make, and we are here to remove the barriers between those who need help (blood in this cas) and those who are willing to give it.

# Part II: Settling In

## Your first 2 weeks

You have joined tabarro3.ma and found your way around the team. Now what you should focus on in your first two weeks as a tabarro3.ma volunteer:

### **Week 1: Learning & Setup**

-   Complete Training 1: Understanding Morocco's blood donation crisis and how tabarro3.ma works (1.5 hours)
-   Get familiar with the platform - create your donor profile, explore features
-   Join relevant WhatsApp groups and introduce yourself
-   Shadow an experienced volunteer during a campaign or outreach activity
-   Read through our key messaging and myth-busting materials

### **Week 2: First Actions**

-   Complete Training 2: Becoming an effective tabarro3.ma ambassador (1.5 hours)
-   Start your personal outreach plan - identify 20 people in your network to approach
-   Register 5 new donors through your personal network
-   Participate in one organized blood drive or awareness event
-   Connect with local associations/clubs in your city for potential partnerships

**By the end of week 2, you should be able to:**

-   Explain Morocco's blood shortage and debunk common myths about blood donation
-   Walk someone through registering on tabarro3.ma
-   Respond to basic questions about blood donation with confidence
-   Have a clear plan for your first month's activities

Now that what you would work on mostly, but if you are generous with your time and you become familiar with our values and culture; you can become an ambassador.
What you should focus on as an ambassador?

### **Becoming an Ambassador**

-   You become [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/)'s face in your city. Build relationships with hospitals, universities, Rotaract clubs, and medical associations.
-   Manage volunteers in your city, conduct Training 1 & 2 for new recruits, and ensure they hit their targets.
-   Track your team's impact (donors recruited, events organized) and report monthly to help us improve.
-   Monthly coordination calls with other city ambassadors

### **Time Commitment for Ambassadors**

Being an ambassador is rewarding but requires dedication. On average, ambassadors spend 4â€“5 hours per week managing volunteers, connecting with partners, and reporting on activities. During peak periods like national campaigns or emergency blood drives, this may increase. Transparency about time expectations helps you plan realistically and prevents burnoutâ€”remember.

### **Joining the Emergency Response Team**

If you are even more generous with your time and have spent some significant time with us , you can become an emergency response team member.

-   You'll have admin access right to the platform
-   When urgent requests come in, quickly identify compatible donors in the same city using our database
-   Send SMS, WhatsApp messages, or make direct calls based on urgency level
-   Monitor who responds and coordinate with hospitals/patients

**Emergency Response Levels:**

-   **Level 1 (Critical)**: Direct phone calls to top 10 compatible donors
-   **Level 2 (Urgent)**: WhatsApp messages to 20-30 compatible donors
-   **Level 3 (Standard)**: SMS to all compatible donors in the city

This role requires quick decision-making, clear communication, and availability during evening/weekend hours when emergencies often happen.

## How We Work?

We operate in **sprints** - focused 2-4 week cycles with clear goals. This keeps us agile and responsive to urgent needs.

Each sprint has:

-   **Definition of Done**
-   **Weekly check-ins** (informal, mostly WhatsApp updates)
-   **Sprint review** to celebrate wins and identify improvements

This isn't corporate bureaucracy - it's how we stay coordinated while moving fast.

## **Data Privacy & Confidentiality**

As a volunteer, you may have access to sensitive donor information such as phone numbers, names, and blood types. This information exists only to connect patients with donors and must never be used for personal purposes or shared outside official tabarro3.ma communication. Protecting donor privacy is a core responsibility: keep conversations professional, limit access to authorized platforms, and immediately report any accidental misuse. Our website also holds a large amount of donor data, but we ensure it is securely protected and never used for anything beyond its intended purpose:saving lives through blood donation.

## Collaboration

We don't have rigid hierarchies. Instead, we form small, mission-focused groups:

-   Social Media Team: Create content, manage Instagram/Facebook, engage with followers, and amplify urgent requests
-   Others focus on improving the platform, building new features (that's mostly hamza :))
-   Some work on community outreach such as partnerships, awareness events, or communication.

Each group comes together because people believe in the mission. Roles aren't fixed, you might find yourself doing community outreach today and brainstorming app improvements tomorrow.

**About hours:** _no ghosting if you are busy - just let us know you wouldn't be available - it is volunteering after all_

## What if I mess up?

You will mess up. We all do. Here's what matters: own it quickly, learn from it, and move on.
If you accidentally send wrong information to donors, tell the team immediately so we can correct it. If you miss a deadline, communicate early and help find solutions. If you're unsure about something, askâ€”it's always better than guessing.

## **Offboarding Process**

### **Leaving [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/)**

**Notice Required:**

-   General Volunteers: 2 weeks
-   Ambassadors: 4 weeks
-   Emergency Response: 2 weeks + active case handover

**Steps:**

1. **Notify** your mentor via WhatsApp/email
2. **Document** ongoing responsibilities, contacts, and campaigns
3. **Hand over** to replacement volunteer
4. **Complete** final activity report

**Types of Departure:**

-   **Emergency**: Immediate access removal, leadership handles handovers

# Part III: Feedback and Impact Measurement

## Why Feedback Matters

At [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/), we measure success by impact:

1. Did more people donate blood?
2. Did patients get help faster?
3. Did our platform make donating easier?

We rely on feedback from donors and partner hospitals to improve constantly.

## Peer Feedback

Feedback flows freely here. At the end of each sprint, we do reviews where team members share constructive input. But day-to-day feedback is more important. Good feedback is:

-   **Specific**: Clear examples, not vague opinions
-   **Actionable**: Suggestions that actually help
-   **Kind but honest**: We build each other up

If you see something working well, say so. If something could be better, speak up respectfully.

## Measuring Impact

Unlike businesses chasing profit, we track lives saved. Key metrics:

-   **New donors registered monthly** - Our biggest success metric. More registered donors = faster responses to urgent requests
-   Successful donations facilitated
-   Response time for urgent requests
-   Campaign reach and participation

The more donors on our platform, the better we can serve patients in crisis. Every project should answer: _How does this help save lives through blood donation?_

## Compensation

We're nonprofit, so no corporate bonuses. But impactful work gets celebrated and highlighted in the community. Your real compensation is Ø§Ù„Ø£Ø¬Ø± (Al-ajr).

# Part V: Expanding

## Taking [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/) to New Cities

Every new city needs local champions. We can't parachute in and expect to understand local community dynamics.

When expanding:

-   Find local partners (Rotaract clubs, medical associations, universities)
-   Identify 2-3 enthusiastic volunteers who know their community
-   Research existing blood donation patterns and local challenges
-   Start small with one successful event before scaling

## Building Lasting Partnerships

Best partnerships feel mutual, not transactional. Hospitals, universities, associations should see clear value, better donor turnout, communication tools, expanded reach.

Strong partnerships take time. Deliver on small promises consistently before proposing bigger collaborations.

## Scaling Without Losing Our Soul

Growing from 6 to 30 cities risks becoming bureaucratic nonprofit. Our challenge: staying nimble, personal, mission-focused.

Principles for scaling:

-   Maintain direct contact with people we serve
-   Never let process become more important than impact
-   Stay resourceful, we can achieve great results without big budgets

## What our non-goals?

As we expand, it's just as important to define what we **don't** want to become. Clarity about our _non-goals_ keeps us focused and authentic.

-   We do not intend to use [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/) data or volunteer networks for political campaigns or any type of endorsement.
-   We do not promote commercial products or services through our channels.
-   We do not engage in any activity that compromises our neutrality in serving all Moroccans.

# Epilogue

## Challenges

[tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/) isn't perfect. Sometimes our ideals don't match daily reality. We're still learning. Current challenges:

-   **Reaching donors quickly**: Patients need blood urgently, we need faster mobilization
-   **Raising awareness**: Too many don't know how important regular donation is
-   **Technology gaps**: Platform works but needs to be smoother, faster, more reliable
-   **Scaling partnerships**: Need deeper collaboration with hospitals, schools, companies

We admit these openly because challenges are opportunities, reminders we're building something new and ambitious.

## **Crisis Communication & Escalation**

### **When Leadership Takes Over**

**Auto-escalation situations:**

-   Media inquiries or negative publicity
-   Donor complaints about volunteers
-   Medical emergencies at our events
-   Volunteer conflicts affecting team dynamics
-   Misinformation about [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/) spreading
-   Legal/privacy/data breach issues

### **Crisis Protocol**

**Step 1 (0-2 hours):** Report immediately to leadership WhatsApp group
**Step 2 (2-6 hours):** Leadership assesses and gives you instructions
**Step 3:** Board responds based on severity level

### **Your Role During Crisis**

**DO:**

-   Report immediately with details
-   Document everything (screenshots, quotes)
-   Refer inquiries to leadership
-   Continue normal work unless told to stop

**DON'T:**

-   Respond to media independently
-   Make statements for [tabarro3.ma](http://tabarro3.ma/)
-   Promise actions or policy changes
-   Engage in public debates
-   Share internal crisis communications

## What We're Not Good at Yet

Things we're figuring out:

-   Social media
-   Supporting donors who prefer Darija or Amazigh over English/French/Arabic formal communications
-   Debunking the myths about blood donation
-   Addressing misconceptions about blood donation
-   Connecting with older generations who trust word-of-mouth more than apps
